        <p>(Biff enters. This Biff is dressed up in a suit, and has a yellowy-ginger hair colour rather than the grey he had at the start of the film. 3-D, Match and Skinhead are with him.) You're supposed to be in Switzerland you little son of a bitch! (horrified) My father! Did you get kicked out of another boarding school? (Lorraine takes another sip of her drink.) Damn it Lorraine, do you know how much perfectly good dough I've spent on this no good kid of yours, huh? On all 3 of them?What the hell do you care, we can afford it! (She walks out of the room, tripping over on the way, during the following. Biff follows her.) The least we can do with all that money is provide a better life for our children. Oh, hold on one second. Let's get this straight. Marty is your kid, not mine, and all the money in the world wouldn't do jack shit with that lazy bum.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. Right.</p>
        <p>(They quickly leave, and Doc pulls Marty aside.) Marty, what are you doing, saying you're going to meet Tannen? Doc, don't worry about it! Monday morning, 8 AM. We're gonna be gone, right? Theoretically, yes, but what if the train's late? Late?</p>
