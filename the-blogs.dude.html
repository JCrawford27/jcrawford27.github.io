                Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day. Yeah. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. (he takes George over to where Lorraine is at her locker.) Lorraine. (surprised) Calvin. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
                <br>
                (Doc draws a line from the "F" on the board to the point where the tangent skewed into 1985-A. He then takes out a copy of the Hill Valley Telegraph, “Hill Valley Man Wins Big At Races”. Next to it is a picture of Biff.) Look! It says, right here, that Biff won his first million betting on a horse race in 1958. He wasn't just lucky, he knew because he had all the race results in the sports almanac. That's how he made his entire fortune! Look in his pocket with a magnifying glass. (Marty does so. He sees the almanac in Biff's pocket.) The almanac! (Doc chuckles again) That son of a bitch stole my idea! (He slams his fist on the table.) He must have been listening when I...it's my fault! If I hadn't bought that damn book, none of this would ever have happened! Well, that's all in the past.

                (Realizing that Doc isn't there he runs back outside. He looks around and spots the Saloon.) (Saloon) (Everyone in the Saloon is watching Doc with his shot glass.) How much has he had? None. That's his first one and he hasn't touched it, yet. He just likes to hold it.
                <br>
                That's our failsafe point. Up until that point we can stop the locomotive before it plunges over the ravine. But once we pass that windmill, it's the future or bust. (Later) (Doc and Marty are going to try out the model train to make sure that everything will work out.) Here you go, Marty. Connect that to the positive terminal. All right, Marty, you all set? Yeah, yeah, go.
                <br>
                Griff/Data/Whitey/Your father? Wrong answer McFly! (Griff throws Marty Jr. over the counter.) Marty Jr.OK Griff, I'll do it, I'll do it buddy, whatever you say. (Marty Jr. falls unconscious. Marty looks at his son.)

                (Saloon) (Doc is still holding his shot glass. He's talking to the entire saloon.) ...but in the future, we don't need horses. We have horseless carriages called auto-mo-biles. (And old man laughs.) If everybody's got one of these automo-whatsits, does anybody walk or run anymore?
                <br>
                Standing up and going over to Doc. I know, I know Doc, it's beautiful. (Copernicus whines.) Oh, it's all right, Copernicus! Everything's going to be fine. I'm sorry, Doc, it's all my fault you're stuck back there. I never should've let Biff get to me. There are plenty worse places to be than the Old West. I could've ended up in the Dark Ages. They probably would've burned me at the stake as a heretic or something. Let's look at the map. It says here the time vehicle is buried here in a side tunnel. We may have to blast.
                <br>
                That's him. (Marty points out George who's walking down the hall. He has a 'kick me' sign on his back and guys keep going by and kicking him in the butt.) Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Maybe you were adopted. Okay, real mature guys. (He drops his books.) Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?

                (He throws it into a gutter on a house.) Well go get it! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. (He walks off.) (w.t) Doc, it is Biff's house, I'm on him. Over. (Courthouse Square) (Biff walks down the street. Marty follows, hiding behind cars. He is not seen by Biff. Biff walks between some kids throwing a ball around.)
                <br>
                (Griff misses Marty but hits the "Ronald Reagan" video waiter. Cut to behind Griff. We see him grow a bit taller - due to his bionic implants probably. We see Marty looking up to him as he grows.) All right, punk! Hey look! (Griff looks. Marty tries to punch him, but Griff catches Marty's fist and smiles evilly at him. Marty then kicks Griff and Griff lets go. Marty then pushes him into his gang and they all fall to the floor.) (Outside)

                47? That's a hell of a good facelift. (Street) (Marty and Doc are watching the cops.) What the hell are they doing Doc? They used her thumbprint to assess her ID. Since her thumbprint never changes over the years they simply assume she's the Jennifer of the future.
                <br>
                (Roof) (Marty runs to the edge of the roof and looks down. Biff approaches him.) Go ahead, kid. Jump. Suicide'll be nice and neat. What if I don't? (Biff pulls out the gun and points it at Marty.)
                <br>Oh. (Coffee Shop) (They enter the coffee shop.) Will you take care of that? Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. (he takes a drink and then goes over to Lorraine's table.) Lorraine, my density has popped me to you.
                <br>
                Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? No, no, no, no, no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids! (The DeLorean) (Inside Marty and Jennifer are seated in the passenger seat while Doc is driving.)

George, help me, please. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.
                <br>
                (w.t) On the roof, 10-4. (Marty turns the corner to meet up with Biff's gang.) 3-Hey, it's him! And he's in disguise! Guys, what's that?
                <br>
                Oh boy, oh boy Mom, you sure can hydrate a pizza. (Marty takes a bite.) Now I'm sorry I missed that whole thing. (Hallway) (o.s) Now I'm just worried about Jennifer. (Kitchen) Why isn't she home yet?

                Relax Marty, it's a sleep-induced alpha-rhythm generator. She was asking too many questions and no-one should know too much about their future. Then what did you bring her for? I had to do something! She saw the time machine, I couldn't just leave her there with that information. Don't worry, she's not essential to my plan. You're the Doc, Doc. Here's our exit.
                <br>
                (Biff presses a button which calls for security.) (Hallway) (Marty runs out of the room and sees the elevator. He runs to it, just as 3-D, Match and Skinhead come out of it.) 3-Hey, get back here! Hey, hey!
                <br>
                There's going to be plenty of rain all right. Wind, thunder, lightning. It's going to be one hell of a storm. Well, thanks. Nice talking to you. Maybe we'll bump into each other some time again in the future. Or in the past. (1985 Doc gets on his bike and ride off, ringing his bell. 1955 Doc looks up. That ring sounded very familiar!) (High School)
